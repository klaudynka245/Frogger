# Frogger
## Author: Klaudia Janicka

### Frogger is a 1981 arcade action game.   The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards. I've chosen this game, because it's one of those I can remember from childhood and I have a lot of good memories from playing it.
